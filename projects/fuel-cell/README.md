  The Methanol Fuel Cell prototype is able to generate electrical power from feed streams of air and methanol fed to a fuel cell stack. The device adjusts methanol and air flow rates to maintain power output that is directed to a power bank using USB connectors. Builders will gain experience with chemical processes, electrochemistry, calibration, coding in python, and likely 3D printing.
  
  Further extensions could include engineering membrane electrode assemblies, cost performance optimization, etc.

# Methanol Fuel Cell - Background
![Methanol Fuel Cell](img/methanol_fuel_cell_NASA_Wikipedia.jpg)

A methanol fuel cell generates electricity from feed streams of methanol and oxygen (here, air). Under acidic conditions, this occurs by anodic oxidation of methanol to yield protons that flow through a proton exchange membrane where they reduce oxygen to water at the anode. The half cell reactions are shown below

Anode: $$\ce{CH3OH + H2O -> 6H+ + 6e- + CO2}$$

Cathode: $$\ce{3/2 O2 + 6H+ + 6e- -> 3H2O}$$
